# NHIS-2017-data-analysis

Project Description:

My primary interest was always in healthcare and wanted to study the relationships between the variables and learn methods to analyze the health survey data by using python. 

The dataset I am studying for this project is from the National Health Interview Survey 2017, release from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The survey is collected by the Census from face to face interview in the United States. It contains health and exhaustion information of individuals categorized to sex, education, marital status, weight and height. I have specified to use the “person file” in the form of csv file. The 2017 data contains a total of 44640 columns and 43667 rows.

All modules introduced in the project should run first in prior to running any other codes. Types of import includes: csv, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, and math. Also, the order of the coding should run in descending order.
